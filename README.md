## Description

This is a simple portfolio project built with React, bootstrapped by Vite.  The goal was to get used to using important concepts of React, such as using reusable components and also utilizing state and state changes to provide a more responsive user experience.  I also used this project to get to know Bootstrap better, although ultimately I ended up falling back to regular CSS in a lot of cases when spacing or formatting got weird.  The hardest part of this project was figuring out how and where to implement certain bootstrap classes, as well as getting used to the concept of state changes.  

There is some more work to be done, as I would like to provide some more sleek styling to the entire page as well as pretty up the portfolio cards.  Specifically, I'd like to add some on-hover effects that will make the title and subtitle parts pop visually.  However, the website as it is works and that's all I needed it to do at the moment.
